### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, welcome to my Github!

<br>

## Some facts about me:

- Python + Django backend developer
- Member of the @TomorrowDevs community 
- I have a University background in Economics and I am currently taking my first steps into Data Science and Machine Learning
- One day I would love to work within an international team where I could speak English on a daily basis

<br>

## My current projects:
-------------
As a member of @TomorrowDevs, I am currently working on the following team project:\
**building an Image Recognition Webapp**\
My work is related to the back-end side and requires me to use the framework Django with RESTful APIs in order to interact with the front-end.\

Here is what we have got so far:\

Acquired skills (ongoing):\
Django views and models, JWT standard,\
 Git versioning, collaborative Github workflow (branching, merging, pull requests),
 Agile methodology, retrospectives,



-------------
In my spare time, I like to work on a small project:\
**a duplicate finder program**\
it is a program which, starting from a root directory, will find a list of duplicate files, based on a specified file extension (.txt, .jpeg, .png, etc.), and if not specified, it will look ignore extensions. All duplicates that are found will be moved to a new folder and the user can decide whether to delete them or not after double-checking them.\
My idea is to add new functionalities to the program as well as to make it look better.
